## Your Individual Presentations

One of the great advantages of the Flipped Classroom model is that it gives you a chance to not only learn new content, but to share what you've learned with your classmates and your professor. 

As part of this course, you will deliver two presentations to the class on topics selected from the course material. Your presentation should be between 10-15 minutes including some time for questions. This time is flexible - if you get a lot of questions, you can exceed 15 minutes, but strive for about 10 minutes of presentation with 5 minutes for questions as an average. 

To prepare for your presentation, I will provide resource guides for each week in this repository. The resource guides will give you the basic information you need and some key points to consider, but will *not* include all of the substance, context and details you should include in your presentation. Spend some time doing your own research to obtain additional information. It's also great to tell a short personal anecdote or story for added context if you have one!

It's also a great idea to include a list of references in your presentation - this can simply be websites you used when putting together your material (no need to cite in any particular academic format). 

### Scoring Rubric

Presentations are scored on a 0-5 scale for three criteria. The following is the scoring rubric for presentations:

&nbsp; | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
-|---|---|---|---|---|---
**Coverage of technical topic material (60%)** | Presentation does not cover the assigned topic or no presentation given | Presentation very minimally mentions the assigned topic, but does not present any useful information | Presentation covers the bare minimum or mostly copies the resource guide with no additional substance or context | Presentation covers all of the topic content but with no examples or additional context or information | Presentation covers all of the topic content in detail, with specific examples or relevant contextual details | Presentation thoroughly covers all of the topic content, with specific examples and actionable advice and/or non-obvious contextual additions
**Clarity of spoken presentation (25%)** | No presentation is given | Presentation consists of only reading content from slides | Presentation consists of reading content from slides with minimal, unsubstantial extra comments | Presentation consists of slide content along with minimal additional context | Presentation covers slide content with well-spoken additional context and details | Presentation delivery is exemplary and significantly above average
**Quality of presentation slides (15%)** | No presentation slides are used | Slides are extremely bare-bones and do not contain significant information | Slides contain the bare minimum content for presentation delivery; many slides contain excessive and/or unreadable text or other significant design issues | Slides contain appropriate bullet points or other visual aids; minimal excessive and/or unreadable text or design issues | Slides contain well-written, succinct bullet points which align well with the spoken delivery; no slides with excessive or unreadable text | Slides are extremely well-designed with significantly useful visual aids, no slides with design issues

To calculate your score, each criteria is first computed individually. To do this, the percentage of the criteria is multiplied by a specific number assigned to each of the 0 through 5 scores. (Note: I don't simply multiply the criteria percentage by n/5 = there's a sliding scale as described below). Then, each of these values is added together to arrive at a final percentage. Then the total score available for the presentation is multiplied by this percentage and rounded up (think math.ceiling). 

The scoring factors are as follows:

* 0: **0**
* 1: **0.25**
* 2: **0.5**
* 3: **0.75**
* 4: **0.9**
* 5: **1**

For example, assume you scored 4 on technical content, 5 on spoken delivery and 4 on slide quality. Your score would be: (0.60 * 0.9) + (0.25 * 1) + (0.15 * 0.9) = 0.54 + 0.25 + 0.135 = 0.92 = 92%. 

One thing to point out here is that scoring solid 4's across the board yields a 90% grade - not an 80% grade as you might initially assume. 90% is the minimum for an A. Also note that if you score a 5 on the technical content but a 3 on both other criteria, you're still scoring a 90% which is an A! *Don't freak out if you're not scoring solid 5's* - a 5 across the board represents a presentation that would be worthy of appearing on PBS or delivered to the board of a big tech company. 

### Tips for a Great Presentation

* **Do not include excessive amounts of text on a slide.**. Slides should generally consist of a small number (5-6 maximum) of bullet points, each of which is a talking point, but without the specific details - that's what you deliver in your spoken presentation. Don't copy and paste whole paragraphs. (Use common sense - you can put a famous quote on a slide by itself if it's relevant or fits well into your presentation - the idea is not to include huge blocks of text that nobody will be actually reading since they'll be paying attention to what you're saying out loud!)
* **It's OK to have notes!** If you find yourself struggling to remember everything you want to say and it's too much to include in the bullets, it's perfectly fine to have some note cards or a sheet of paper to refer to while you present. The only thing you should avoid is reading verbatim from your notes. Add some personality and flair to your presentation!
* **Where possible, include a demonstration!** This will not apply to all presentations, but if it makes sense for your presentation, do a live demo! During your live demo, you can show some code, run the code, demonstrate how it works, give advice, etc. If you need extra resources, e.g. test accounts, extra repositories, and so on, talk to me ahead of time and I can give you access to those resources if possible.
* **Limit code on a slide.** Code on slides is good, but don't show more than a few lines of code - maybe 8-9 lines at most. If you have to shrink the font way down to get the code to fit, it's too much code. You can do a live demonstration during which you can show your code, your IDE, and anything else of that nature.
* **Practice, practice, practice!** Public speaking can be scary and daunting, but like most skills in life, practice will make you better and more confident. You've heard it before, and it's all good advice - give the presentation to a friend, to a mirror, to your phone's video camera, to your cat, anything. Time your presentation to make sure you're within a reasonable time window. Take your time with preparation, but don't procrastinate - the more time you spend preparing, the better your delivery will be!
