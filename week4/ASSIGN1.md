# GitHub Actions Getting Started Assignment

This is an *individual assignment*. Each person *must* do their own work!

1. In the organization, create a *new* repository titled `actions-yourname`. 
2. Clone the empty repository to your computer. You'll get a notice that the repo is empty - this is OK, because it still will create the Git file structures on your computer
3. Add a simple `README.md` file containing your name as text.
4. **Follow the [GitHub Actions Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) on Microsoft's website.** The guide will walk you through how to create an Actions script, run it and view the results on GitHub.
5. To complete the assignment, *change the Actions script* so that another command is added that prints your name into the output of the Actions repo.
6. Let your action run and **take a screenshot** of your action running, including the step that prints your name.
7. Submit the screenshot to D2L. I will also be able to see your repository in the organization!
